		<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Rate Your Music is a music-sharing platform where users can discover, share, rate, and discuss a vast array of music and related media such as film. The aim of this usability test was to assess the overall functionality of the website’s community feature. This evaluation specifically focused on pinpointing navigational flaws within the community feature. This feedback was then taken into account and utilized to suggest several ways to improve the feature. I specifically chose the website’s community feature because, as a user, I rarely find myself using it very often which may indicate that it is in need of revision or more appealing sub-features.</p>

<h3>Test Objective</h3>
<p>Through the conducting of a heuristic evaluation, with myself as the expert, I identified several user concerns with the RateYourMusic community feature including disorganized homepage subheadings, a search engine that looked for key headings rather than keywords, the capitalization of ‘groups’ in discussion groups, the confusion between the ‘Posts’ and ‘All’ filters in the search results bar and more cosmetic concerns like the website’s color scheme, unnecessary blank space at the top of the community homepage, as well the relevance of the global user map at the top of the same page. As a result of these observations, I decided to divide the usability test into three categories: Visual Appeal, Organization, and Usability. Participants were asked to give both quantitative and qualitative feedback about the feature.</p>  

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>Participants were first asked to navigate to the community feature and create a RateYourMusic account which they were free to delete after the conclusion of the usability test. Before completing the first task, participants were first asked about their prior experience with rating music and whether they saw themselves doing so in the future, and why.</p> 

<p>For the visual appeal section, participants were asked to locate the ‘users online’ feature, then to locate the ‘Featured posts’ feature, and then locate the global user map. After completing these tasks, the participants were asked to think of the three most visually appealing features of the page as well as one that was less so. After this, participants were asked: ‘How does this page’s organization differ from what you generally expect of a community page?’ and ‘Does the text under each heading provide the most relevant information to the user?’ as well as to voice any additional feedback if they had it.</p> 
 

<p>For the organization section, participants were asked to find the site’s stance on Wiki Editing. After completing the task, participants were asked to answer the following questions: ‘What are three struggles you had in finding this information?,’ ‘What was one aspect of the site’s organization that made this process easier?’ ‘Does the page use the most relevant headings?’ ‘Are there any headings that seem unnecessary or misleading?,’ ‘How does this page’s organization differ from what you generally expect of a community page?’ and ‘Does the text under each heading provide the most relevant information to the user?’ as well as to voice any additional feedback if they had it.</p>

<p>For the usability section, participants were asked to find the user: “rile”’s post on their favorite classical composer. After completing this task, participants were asked to answer the following questions: ‘Was there anything difficult or confusing about the search process?’ and ‘How was your experience with navigating the results you received?’ as well as to voice any additional feedback if they had it.</p>

<p>After completing the tasks and answering the questions for each category, participants were asked to give the website a rating from 1-4 (1 = Unacceptable; 2 = Needs Improvement; 3 = Satisfactory; 4 = No Changes Should Be Made) for each of the broader task categories including Visual Appeal, Organization, and Usability. Participants were also asked to give a brief rationale for their choice.</p>

<h3>Findings</h3>

<h5>Pre Usability Test</h5>
Two of the five participants had used music rating systems before although neither was particularly consistent with their use. The same two participants also expressed an interest in using a music rating system in the future with the other three users showing little interest.  

<h4>Visual Appeal</h4>

<p>Surprisingly, none of the participants voiced any confusion or displayed any trouble in completing the tasks for this section. Participants were divided however regarding the quality of the site’s visual appeal. While some participants interpreted the minimal visual design of the website positively, referring to it as ‘efficient,’ ‘sleek,’ and ‘professional,’ other participants saw the design choices as ‘template-like’ with several participants pointing out the dark background of the webpage as a frustration as well. Four out of five participants listed the global user map as a design feature they liked although two participants noted that the map was not necessarily the most relevant graphic that could be used on the community homepage. One participant also made the observation that the map helped them determine which page they were on when navigating between pages. Four out of the five users mentioned the column layout as a feature they were less fond of whether it was the ‘monotonous’ size of the columns, the confusing grouping created by them, or the apparent ‘pointlessness’ of their differing sizes given the content they contained.</p>  

<h4>Organization</h4>

<p>For this category, three of the participants completed the tasks without issue. The other two participants struggled to find the site’s stance on Wiki Editing with one participant eventually being able to find it after being overwhelmed by the choices provided to them once they navigated to the ‘site policy’ page and the other giving up after a short period of time. Despite participants’ general success in completing the task, every participant mentioned the topic headings as a struggle in the search process using words like ‘unconventional’ and ‘unintuitive to describe it. Several participants also mentioned that the number of options given in the ‘site policy’ tab to be both excessive, using words such as ‘overwhelming’ and ‘unnecessary’ to describe it.</p> 

<h4>Usability</h4>

<p>Only two participants were able to find the mentioned post. Similar to the organization section, participants took issue with the number of options they were given on each landing page of their search, the main difference here being that this was consistently the reason participants cited when they could not find the aforementioned post with the word ‘impenetrable’ being the strongest adjective used to describe the results found on each page. Of the participants who successfully found the post, both cited the efficiency of the search bar's filtering of results but also noted the large amount of content found on each page they navigated.</p>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>Given the results of this usability test, designers should focus first and foremost on reducing the number of options users have to choose from on any given page. Although this was not a universal concern for participants within the visual appeal category, it became a universal concern in each subsequent section where participants were asked to complete more complex tasks. For several participants, this was enough of a concern that it prevented them from having any interest in the social function of the site which is one of its primary functions. The other major recommendation would be to make the community feature more friendly to new users as participants consistently mentioned, for all three sections the web designers made design choices that made the user experience feel aimed towards creating an insular community.</p>
