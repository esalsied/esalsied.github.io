			<h1>A Book Review Essay of <i>The Selected Poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke</i></h1>
		</header>
			<center><span class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_0315.JPG"></span></center>
					<p class="indent">Reflective and inviting, the poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke feels like the ongoing diary of the best friend you never had. In Stephen Mitchell’s translation of a wide selection of Rilke’s poetry, the pursuit of the poet’s original intent is admirable not only for Mitchell’s ability to capture the poet’s occasionally cryptic style but also for his immensely readable English renderings of Rilke’s German. Overall, Mitchell’s translation creates a sort of biographical portrait of Rilke’s ideas and how they evolved over the course of his life.</p>
				<h4>I. Close Reading</h4>
					<p class="indent">One of the common features of Rilke’s poetic style is his emphasis on the individual experience. This is strange considering that his poems often revolve around topics such as the limits of our experience and the fleeting nature of our being. However, rather than making his poetry feel contradictory, this contrast between style and subject matter is what I believe makes Rilke’s words resonate so deeply. This emphasis on individual experience can be found in Rilke’s early poem, <i>[I am, O Anxious One. Don’t you hear my voice]</i> from The Book of Hours, when the poem’s speaker says “If you are the dreamer, I am what you dream. / But when you want to wake, I am your wish” (Rilke 3, Lines 9-10). The speaker in this poem seems to be an angel or divine being who is telling the poem’s subject that they have nothing to worry about because the being will be present in all that they do even when they ascend away from the Earth and into the stars. What catches my eye in these lines is their use of the pronoun “you.” Considering the scope of where they reside, the speaker could have easily chosen a broader subject for these lines. Yet the speaker addresses “you” as if our anxious thoughts are significant to the point that the being wants to reassure us and though we may not be the only one the being is concerned for, they still pay attention to our individual self. These lines also elicit a sense of inescapability from the divine, an idea Rilke further explores in the poetry he wrote near the end of his life.</p>
					<p class="indent">In Rilke’s earliest poems, there is the sense that humans are insignificant compared to the world that surrounds them. This observation seems rooted in Rilke’s awe when faced with a natural world which he believes to be God’s creation. Interestingly though, he does not see the power of God exhibited through nature as obvious upon initial inspection as demonstrated by the following lines from <i>[I find you, Lord, in all Things and in all]</i> from <i>The Book of Hours</i>:
					<div class="poetry">
					<p>The wondrous game power plays with Things<br>
						is to move in such submission through the world:<br>groping in roots and growing thick in trunks<br>
					and in treetops like a rising from the dead (Rilke, Lines 5-8).</p>
					</div>
					In this excerpt, Rilke’s speaker seems to be pointing out that the natural world, in its silent progression, appears fragile and easy to manipulate on the surface. In reality, the natural world is extremely robust and only appears submissive because its power is hidden away from the observer, whether it is deep within the roots of a tree or far above in treetops beyond the observers’ vision. It is interesting how ‘Things’ is capitalized here. This could perhaps imply that the speaker is not just referring to a specific set of things from the world but rather all material things contained within this world. Above all, these lines imply that we frequently overlook nature and, in turn, God and maintain an illusion of our superiority as a result.</p>
					<p class="indent">From his early poems, we can gather that Rilke has a deep admiration for the natural world in all its subtle beauty. It is important, however, that we distinguish between the natural world and our being within the natural world because, for Rilke, the latter brings about completely different feelings. This is made apparent in an excerpt from his poem <i>Requiem For a Friend</i> from the larger collection <i>Requiem</i> when, while reflecting on the passing of a friend, the speaker realizes that “We transform these Things; / they aren’t real, they are only the reflections /
					upon the polished surface of our being” (Rilke 73, Lines 10-12). Here Rilke’s speaker is mourning the loss and commemorating the life of a deceased friend. This excerpt comes after the speaker voices their surprise that the ghost of their friend would wish to come back to this world for any reason. As a result, these lines become a sort of reiteration of the speaker’s own beliefs about the world. The speaker seems to be saying that all the features of our world we interact with are nothing more to us than projections of our own existence which we try to make as ideal as possible. For the speaker, this makes our existence in this world inferior to that of the friend residing on a higher plane. The previous excerpt also capitalized ‘Things’ and used the word in a similar context yet it elicits different emotions in each poem. In the previous poem, the use of the word ‘Things’ makes our world feel vast and bountiful. In this poem, the use of the word ‘Things’ makes our world feel confined and arbitrary as if we are just wasting our time in it. These lines demonstrate a dimension of the existential concerns Rilke is often associated with, concerns that would only deepen as his life progressed.</p>
					<p class="indent">This brings us to the <i>Duino Elegies</i> which takes the ideas touched upon earlier in Rilke’s poetry and questions them as intensely as possible. The result is a brutally honest reflection on our finite existence in a world in which we are out of place. Our inability to fit in with our surrounding world is demonstrated in the following lines from <i>The First Elegy</i> in which, after expressing the terror found in beauty, the speaker says:
					<div class="poetry">
					<p>Ah, who can we ever turn to<br>
						In our need? Not angels, not humans,<br>
						And already the knowing animals are aware<br>
						That we are not really home in<br>
					Our interpreted world (Rilke 151, Lines 9-13).</p>
					</div>
					Here, the speaker points out that nothing around us can point out the logic in our suffering. Angels cannot point it out as they exist beyond our suffering and, in this instance, set it in motion Neither can other humans because they face the same suffering and the same need for reassurance we crave for ourselves. And not Earth’s other animals who, in being unable to communicate with us, know that we do not really belong to this world anyway, and thus, seeking an honest consolation for our fears is like searching for something that does not exist. In referencing angels, this poem brings us back to the speaker of the first poem we analyzed who, then a singular figure, surrounded us with a reassuring presence but is now a distant figure whose inability to relate to our concerns leaves us feeling intimidated and at odds with our own existence.</p>
					<p class="indent">Along with being out of place, our existence is delicate, fading slowly in response to time and emotion. In <i>The Second Elegy</i>, the speaker articulates this withering, claiming that “we, when moved by deep feeling, evaporate; we / Breathe ourselves out and away; from moment to moment / our emotion grows fainter like a perfume” (Rilke 157, Lines 18-20). In this excerpt, the speaker reveals a tragic aspect of our being in that our capacity to experience our life only shrinks the more passionately we try to live it. Ultimately, these speakers from the <i>Duino Elegies</i> find humanity trapped within its own misfortunes, left to repeat itself again and again.</p>
					<p class="indent">Although bleak and cryptic, the <i>Duino Elegies</i> are not Rilke’s final work. Acting as a sort of counterpart to its predecessor, <i>The Sonnets to Orpheus</i> sings of the hope to be found in that which never dies. In sonnet <i>I, 3</i>, responding to a human’s desire to sing like the gods, the speaker urges them to “learn // To forget that passionate music. It will end. / True singing is a different breath, about / Nothing. A gust inside the god. A wind” (Rilke 231, Lines 11-14). Although these lines at first seem monotone and emotionless due to their declarative and frequently punctuated structure, they urge the human to admire the music of the natural world which, in being immortal, constantly changes and can sound like something new every time it is heard. In this sense, we abandon our need for superiority over the world and are instead curious about what it has to say. Our existence then, rather than being a burden to overcome, is a peaceful concurrence with the world we are part of.</p> 
				<h4>II. Overall Discussion</h4>
					<p class="indent">Since the poems in this book were taken from several different poetry collections and then put in chronological order, it felt sort of like I was reading an unconventional biography of Rilke’s poetic ideas. I also think that, since Mitchell selected very few poems from some collections and the majority of poems from other collections, my reading of Rilke’s poetry may have been influenced more by the collections with the greatest number of poems present than those which were less represented. Also, since this book pulls from a number of individual collections, it was more difficult to bring together universal themes since Rilke likely had different intentions, with each collection addressing themes that do not necessarily show up through all of his poetry.</p>
					<p class="indent">Reading a large quantity of Rilke’s poetry definitely changed my preconceived notions about him being a gloomy, existential poet. While he certainly wrote his fair share of depressive, tragic poems, my impression of him after reading more of his work is that he had a passionate affection for human life and wanted, through his poetry, to make the reader feel appreciated, as if someone has recognized their struggles. Reading a lot of Rilke’s poetry also made me realize how versatile a poet he was. Beyond his ability to write equally substantive poems in longer forms like requiems as well as shorter forms like sonnets, he was also able to blend realistic imagery with mystic and mythological symbolism.</p>
					<p>It is difficult to critically analyze this book without evaluating Mitchell’s translation ability rather than the content of Rilke’s poetry. That being said, I think both were very well done. While there were a few instances where a poem felt like an exercise rather than a fully realized work, these instances were few and far between. Even in the more obscure, shorter poems within this selection, Rilke’s emotional honesty, and openness almost always shine through and shine brightest with poems such as <i>Requiem For a Friend</i> and the complete <i>Duino Elegies</i>. Mitchell’s translation of the complete <i>Duino Elegies</i> particularly shines because he is able to strike a balance between readability and authentic interpretation of the original German. I found the same to be true for the vast majority of Mitchell’s translations here, although there were a few preposition translations that made the language feel a bit stilted, this really was not much of an issue though.</p>
					<p class="indent">Since this collection is itself a compilation of many individual collections, its goal was more to provide a diverse selection of Rilke’s poetry rather than a book of poems centered around the same few themes. This is why I do not see there being much of a larger argument or narrative/emotional arc throughout the book.</p>
					<p class="indent">Speaking of broader implications though, I think Rilke’s work shows that poetry can be a therapeutic space where the poet can show us how to think about ourselves, others, and the world in a healthier, more positive light even if their intention was simply to write down what was on their mind without any further thought. My biggest takeaway from reading this selection is that, while humanity may stick out like a sore thumb and life itself can feel like a process of being slowly erased, there is so much to appreciate in the world around us be it nature or even other people, that living is worth the short time we spend doing it.</p>
