			<h1>Heuristic Evaluation</h1>
		</header>
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Rate Your Music is a music-sharing platform where users can discover, share, rate, and discuss a vast array of music and related media such as film. The website has been operating since 2000 and is particularly known for its five-star rating system and charts which rank individual releases according to a wide selection of categories, with genre and year of release being the most prominent.</p>

		<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The aim of this heuristic evaluation is to assess the overall functionality of the website’s community feature. This evaluation was particularly focused on pinpointing navigational flaws within the community feature as indicated by the feedback of a single experienced user's observations. This feedback will then be taken into account and utilized to present an improved version of the community feature. I specifically chose the website’s community feature because, as a user of the website myself, I do not find myself using the feature very often which could indicate that it is in need of revision or more appealing sub-features.</p> 

		<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>Given my extensive previous experience as a Rate Your Music User, I designated myself as the expert user for this heuristic evaluation. I began my feedback by observing the style choices of the community feature homepage without clicking on any links or paying attention to any of the content displayed. After noting my stylistic observations, I reevaluated the same homepage looking specifically at how its content was formatted and displayed. After noting my formatting observations, I began interacting with the page more directly by conducting a search under the ‘Music’ search category and noted my observations in the process. In order to ensure that the feedback I receive from other users addresses similar concerns, I will likely classify my questions for other users under categories similar to the progression I followed to conduct my observations.</p>

<h3>Findings</h3> 

<h5>A. Homepage Global Map</h5>
<p>Catches the user’s attention but does very little to draw the user further into the community feature or inform the user how to use the feature. (Severity = 1)
<i>*Suggestion-</i> Implement a more sophisticated navigation menu in place of the global map to draw the user’s attention to something with more practical use.</p> 

<h5>B. Color Scheme & Spacing</h5>
<p>The navy blue background forces all text on the page to use light colors. Altogether, these stylistic choices may be visually taxing for some users, especially individuals who are farsighted. Overall, the color scheme makes it difficult to focus on the page for an extended period of time. (Severity = 2)</p>
<p><i>Suggestion-</i> Choose a color scheme that is easier on the eyes (i.e gray, etc.)</p>
<p>There is unnecessary blank space above the ‘Discussion groups’ heading which makes the top portion of the page look somewhat empty and poorly planned out. (Severity = 1)
<i>*Suggestion-</i> This is another issue that could be solved by a more prominent navigation bar.</p>

<h5>C. Headings On Homepage</h5>
<p>‘Groups’ in ‘Discussion groups’ is not capitalized but definitely should be since it is a central feature. (Severity = 2)</p>
<p><i>*Suggestion-</i> Capitalize the word ‘Groups’</p>
<p>The subheadings on the homepage are not very well organized. For example, the heading ‘Music Polls/Games’ seems like an odd pairing that would benefit from a broader subheading. Then other subheadings like those designated for film, video games, Tv, literature & art, etc. are given the same prominence that the music subheadings have which could potentially be overwhelming or confusing for the user. (Severity = 3)</p>
<p><i>*Suggestion-</i> Come up with broader subheadings to avoid odd pairings of specific features. Make the non-music-related subheadings less prominent than the music-related ones.</p>

<h5>D. Miscellaneous User Posts at the Bottom of the Page</h5>
<p>The last section of the homepage consists of what I assume are the most recent posts but this is not made clear. These posts are poorly organized in that they give the user a very little indication as to where within the community feature they are located much less why there are other users listed below each of these posts. Overall, this portion of the homepage looks thrown together and not very well organized. (Severity = 3)</p>
<p><i>*Suggestion-</i> Anything like a recent posts feature would be better served as either a menu option for the ‘Featured Posts’ category or as a minor search filter category. Restructuring this section of the homepage would allow the page to be shorter in length so the user does not have to stroll so far down to get to the bottom.</p>

<h5>E. Search Feature Confusion</h5>   
<p>There are three filter options one can choose from after conducting a search: ‘All, Posts, and Threads’. As a user, the differences between the ‘All’ and ‘Posts’ features seemed to be minor as both categories featured many of the same posts. (Severity = 2)</p>
<p><i>*Suggestion-</i> Although I think the division between ‘All’, ‘Posts’, and ‘Threads’ is good, I think making the differences between the ‘All’ and ‘Posts’ features more prominent would go a long way in making this feature easier to navigate.</p>
<p>The search engine is programmed to look primarily for keywords from a search and organized the search results by displaying keyword matches. While this may be useful in certain contexts, I think it makes for a more disorienting user experience in this context and motivated me as a user to look elsewhere to find more straightforward search results. (Severity = 3)</p>
<p><i>*Suggestion-</i> I think it would be better for the search results to be organized by post heading matches rather than keyword matches within each post. This way, the user sees a wider variety of posts beyond those that simply happen to use a certain keyword/keywords.</p>

<h4><i>High-Priority Concerns</i></h4>
<p>This included the disorganized subheadings on the homepage, the random recent posts at the bottom of the home page, and the programming of the search engine to look for keywords rather than key headings. These issues will involve the most substantial reworking but are, nonetheless, the most crucial features to fix.</p>

<h4><i>Medium-Priority Concerns</i></h4>
<p>Medium level concerns included the color scheme choice for the website as a whole, the capitalization of ‘groups’ in discussion groups, and the confusion between ‘Posts’ and ‘All’. These features generally involve higher-order changes and should be a moderate priority.</p>

<h4><i>Low-Priority Concerns</i></h4>
<p>Most of the stylistic concerns were lower priority concerns. This includes the extra spacing at the top of the community homepage and the inclusion of the global user map on the homepage. Both of these issues will not make or break the webpage if they are not addressed and are relatively quick fixes if they are addressed.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Given my findings after using Rate Your Music’s community feature, I have concluded that feedback from other users would be best focused on three specific categories. In accordance with the concerns I had with the visual appearance of the community page, the first feedback category will focus on Visual Appeal. Following my observations about the structure and layout of the community page, the second feedback category will focus on Organization. The third feedback category will focus on Usability specifically in terms of the user’s experience with navigating through various search features within the community feature. By asking other users to ground their feedback within these three categories, I will ideally receive insights that are specific enough to warrant further investigation but that still fit within the broader set of concerns about the community feature that I want to address. I am also confident that having other users navigate the community feature will yield other design, organization, and usability issues that I did not pick up on while making my own observations.</p>
