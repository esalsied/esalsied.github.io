		<h3>Participants</h3>
<p>Although I primarily had a younger demographic in mind for the testing of the RateYourMusic community feature, I thought that including participants from an older demographic would provide equally useful testing insights despite being a group less likely to use this feature broadly speaking. Three of my participants will be college-age students ranging from ages 19-21. Although none of these participants have used RateYourMusic before, they all have an affinity for music and the wider discussion it creates, making the community feature something these participants would be more likely to use than other participants who do not share these same interests. The other two participants will range in age from 35-58. Neither of these participants had any prior experience with RateYour Music, but both have extensive career experience with web design which I believe is a valuable perspective for this test in particular.</p> 

<h3>Scenarios</h3>
<p>This first scenario is for the college-age participants:</p>

<p>James, a 19-year-old college student, has recently been getting more interested in music since he’s begun college. Although he appreciates discussing music and receiving recommendations from his immediate friend group, he wants to branch out and learn about artists, genres, and communities he is not already familiar with. Even though James is open to discovering new finding new music, he finds learning about these things overwhelming when the sources he learns about them from make no effort to be beginner-friendly which is often a problem when looking for communities.</p>     

<p>This second scenario is for the older participants:</p>

<p>June, a 53-year-old technical writer, has listened to music casually for years. Despite this, June has developed an extensive knowledge of many musical genres given the variety of music that those around her have listened to over the years, mostly through her immediate family. Recently, one of June’s work friends has floated around the idea of cataloging the music they’ve listened to, seeing how each of their lists compares to those of other people online and seeing if they get any interesting recommendations in the process which is less of a major priority than the other ones mentioned.</p>   

<h3>Tasks</h3>
<p>I have decided to divide up the tasks for this usability test into Visual Appeal, Organization, and Usability based on my findings about the RateYourMusic community feature in the previous Heuristic Evaluation. The instructions will go as follows:</p>

<p>The Visual Appeal section will contain the following instructions and questions:

<br>“First, locate the ‘users online’ feature. Next, locate the ‘Featured posts’ feature. Then locate the global user map.
 
<br>What are three of the most visually appealing features you noticed on this page while completing the task and what is one that you found less visually appealing?

<br>Now that you have completed the task, answer the following questions.  

<br>How does this page’s organization differ from what you generally expect of a community page?

<br>Does the text under each heading provide the most relevant information to the user?”</p>

<p>The Organization section will contain the following instructions and questions:
  
<br>“Your task for this section is to find the site’s stance on Wiki Editing. Now that you have completed the task, please answer the following questions.

<br>What are three struggles you had in finding this information? What was one aspect of the site’s organization that made this process easier?
  
<br>Does the page use the most relevant headings? Are there any headings that seem unnecessary or misleading?

<br>How does this page’s organization differ from what you generally expect of a community page?

<br>Does the text under each heading provide the most relevant information to the user?”</p>

<p>The Usability section will contain the following instructions and questions:

<br>“Your task is to find the user: “rile”’s post on their favorite classical composer. Now that you have completed this task, please answer the following questions.

<br>Was there anything difficult or confusing about the search process?

<br>How was your experience with navigating the results you received?”</p>

<p>After completing the above-mentioned tasks, participants will then be asked to give the website a rating from 1-4 (1 = Unacceptable; 2 = Needs Improvement; 3 = Satisfactory; 4 = No Changes Should Be Made) for each of the broader task categories including Visual Appeal, Organization, and Usability. Participants were then asked to give a brief rationale for their choice. After completing all parts of their Community function evaluation, users will be asked to send their responses via email at their earliest convenience.</p>
 

<h3>Risk Mitigation</h3>

<p>Although there do not seem to be many potential risks for this test, one possible risk is that the RateYourMusic website layout may look different for different users depending on the operating system they are using or even the browser they are using.</p> 
<p><i>Solution-</i> Require that all users test the RateYourMusic community feature using the latest windows operating system and the latest version of Google Chrome.</p>
<p>The other potential risk I see is the user being a bit disoriented on the website with minimal or vague instructions beforehand.</p>
<p><i>Solution-</i> I plan to have participants read through the following text before completing the above-mentioned tasks: 
“As part of a heuristic evaluation of the website Rate Your Music, you will answer several questions about your experience with the site’s community tab. These questions focus on the visual appeal, organization, and usability of the community tab and its various search functions. Please elaborate further than ‘yes’ and ‘no’ in your responses. This link takes you to the site’s homepage: https://rateyourmusic.com/
You will need to create an account for the usability portion of this evaluation. Feel free to include as little information as necessary and delete your account after the evaluation if you wish to do so. Once you reach the Rate Your Music homepage, navigate to the Community tab in the menu at the top of the page.”</p>
