					<p class="indent">Thomas was always held back by something. If it wasn’t the result of his own lack of confidence, it must have been those around him. This held back feeling used to concern him but, as the years passed, he learned to live beside himself; to take things as they came and watch them indifferent as they went. Now Thomas was standing by the water cooler about three feet to the right of his desk. He marketed insurance bundles to people who would rather have had anything happen to them over putting up with his spiel.</p>
					<p class="indent">Even though Thomas had a certain apathy towards his being held back, this didn’t stop him from doing things that made him feel like he was progressing towards a positive change. By working as an insurance marketer, he believed he was forcing himself to have more confidence in what he had to say as if his invasive pitches were somehow expressions of freedom and independence. The danger in the way Thomas was living stemmed from the fact that he had framed a concept of productivity in his mind that he committed to unflinchingly. This turned into a sort of self-destruction when he became oblivious to his unrealistic visions of himself and the future he anticipated.</p>
					<p class="indent">With a mild-mannered grin, he took four steps back to his seat. None of the customers he phoned today answered. This was how most days went and how they’d likely unfold in the future. Because of this, Thomas had developed a habit of planning out his spiel before calling as if his words were going to change anything about anyone else’s life. There was usually at least one call that would go through over the course of a workday but today this wasn’t the case. Embodying the expression of someone who says “we’ll get ‘em next time” Thomas rose from his chair, straightened up his workspace, picked up his belongings, and left for the day.</p>
					<p class="indent">Today was the Friday before a long weekend. Despite Thomas’ productivity, he would frequently succumb to the pressure of doing absolutely nothing with his free time to the point that the only fragments of memory drifting through his mind were those from his nearly identical days spent in the office. Now, his free time was simply a formality in his awkward effort to prove that he could be something different than what he already was.</p>
					<p class="indent">This weekend started like any other, 6:00 wake up, morning cardio, oatmeal and coffee, the paper. Nothing was different and nothing ever would be. This thought entered Thomas’ mind as he washed out his oatmeal bowl. He lowered the bowl onto the counter. Something was different. Within the next half hour, he was gone.</p>
