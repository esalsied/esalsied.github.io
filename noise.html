					<p class="indent">While I’m slumped in my chair typing away vigorously, a noise reaches me from behind the couch. The couch wasn’t in my line of sight. In fact, I’m faced directly in the opposite direction of it but I could tell by its consistency that this was where the noise was coming from. This isn’t how I thought about the sound now though because I’d been through this several times before, to the point of my reaction being reflexive.</p>
					<p class="indent">I live alone as far as I know and have for about five years. I used to find company with my mom and her two cats. Dad was never fully in the picture, always just out of frame. My mom isn’t dead but she feels like it to me. Now I find company with myself although things can be a bit tough-going sometimes. I bring up these facts about my life because the way I feel about the sound I’m hearing now brings me back to a memory with mom and the cats.</p>
					<p class="indent">Growing up, we lived in an apartment building full of noises and about as much life as you could find in a closed space. There was always more noise coming from above than below. The only problem was that our apartment was on the topmost floor of the complex. The noise wasn’t periodic but felt that way because it always occurred just after it crossed my mind. Because of this, I was often unsure whether or not the noise was actually occurring. For some reason knowing that the noise was real felt more comforting than knowing I had imagined it. At least then I knew that my experience was something I had in common with someone else without the added anxiety of maintaining my own presence in the situation to keep the experience common. I say someone else when I should really just say my mom and her cats since they were the only ones I looked to for this common experience.</p>
					<p class="indent">After years of hearing the noise with this mindset, the recognition I once sought out from mom and her cats didn’t really matter anymore because I just came to assume it was there even though it’d be obvious it wasn’t with just a little thought. At first, they reacted to the noise the same way I did; with that stop-whatever-you’re-doing pause and the confiding eye contact. As time passed, mom and the cats found this reaction redundant and were much more content with continuing on with whatever they were doing as if paying the noise no mind would appease it in some way. Of course, they would continue on doing whatever they were doing anyway so maybe I’m just trying to explain a constant I hoped would change. It never did change. Mom and the cats had tuned out the noise and in so doing tuned me out as well.</p>
					<p class="indent">Since no one else wanted to recognize the noise, I figured I needed to fill in the space. It all made sense. The noise and I had come to know each other so well over the years and though it gave me nothing but its slightly varying tones, I could always count on it to be there for me. All was going well until one day the noise stopped. My reaction was twofold.</p>
					<p class="indent">First I became shocked because the noise’s ceasing made me realize I had been hearing it constantly without knowing. Then, upon realizing this, I broke down completely. I had taken advantage of the recognition I once confided in from the noise by letting it slip beyond my awareness of the present. I had failed the noise and its stopping was evidence.</p>
					<p class="indent">As I lay on the floor soaking the carpet with my tears, I caught a glimpse of mom and the cats in the living room. They continued as if nothing had ever changed. I knew I had to get away. There was nothing for me there anymore. Everything that occurred around me then was violent and clashing without the noise to balance it. The noise was always there to check in on me, whereas the world I found myself in now only wanted to beat me into a submissive space, a box so barren that anything taken away would become something gained in my eyes.</p>
					<p class="indent">I never told mom and the cats that I left and they never told me they noticed. As the years went by, my search for other noises to fill in the space intensified. I sought out every sound one could imagine when choosing living spaces but I would never try to find a sound that resembled the noise. When I started hearing it again, I was overwhelmed with emotion. The ultimate forgiveness for someone so undeserving of it.</p>
					<p class="indent">Now, the sound continues to emerge from behind the couch. Like I said before, my reflexes have kicked in but then I realize what’s different about the noise now. We are in the same space. There was a safe distance between us before, a barrier. Now the sound is no longer behind the couch. I can feel it standing behind me. It can finally see what I am and I don’t think it likes what it sees. I know now what I need to do as if there was any question before. He’s waiting there and he doesn’t like what I’ve done.
