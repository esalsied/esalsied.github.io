		<p>“As part of a usability test of the website Rate Your Music, you will complete a series of tasks and answer several questions about your experience with the site’s community tab. These questions focus on the visual appeal, organization, and usability of the community tab and its various search functions. Please elaborate further than ‘yes’ and ‘no’ in your responses. The following link takes you to the site’s homepage: (Moderator Reads Out Link) https://rateyourmusic.com/ (Moderator then verifies that the participant is on the correct page)</p>

<p>You will need to create an account for the usability portion of this evaluation. Feel free to include as little information as necessary and delete your account after the evaluation if you wish to do so. Once you reach the Rate Your Music homepage, navigate to the Community tab in the menu at the top of the page.

<br>-Before you begin completing the tasks, I will ask you to answer two questions. First, do you have any prior experience with rating music?

<br>-Thank you. The second question is: do you see yourself using a music rating in the future and why? 

<br>-Great! Now we will move on to the tasks. These tasks will be divided into three categories: Visual Appeal, Organization, and Usability.</p>

<p>We will now begin the visual appeal section. Note that there is no need to rush from step to step for any of the following tasks and that you are encouraged to take your time with each task and in transitioning between each step. First, locate the ‘users online’ feature. Next, locate the ‘Featured posts’ feature. Then locate the global user map.

<br>-What are three of the most visually appealing features you noticed on this page while completing the task and what is one that you found less visually appealing?

<br>-Now that you have completed the task, answer the following questions.  

<br>-How does this page’s organization differ from what you generally expect of a community page?

<br>-Does the text under each heading provide the most relevant information to the user?

<br>-Feel free to leave any additional criticism of the community page’s organization that was not prompted by the questions above.</p>

<p>Now that we have completed the visual appeal section, we will move on to the organization section. Your task for this section is to find the site’s stance on Wiki Editing. Now that you have completed the task, please answer the following questions.

<br>-What are three struggles you had in finding this information? What was one aspect of the site’s organization that made this process easier?
  
<br>-Does the page use the most relevant headings? Are there any headings that seem unnecessary or misleading?

<br>-How does this page’s organization differ from what you generally expect of a community page?

<br>-Does the text under each heading provide the most relevant information to the user?

<br>-Feel free to leave any additional criticism of the community page’s organization that was not prompted by the questions above.</p>

<p>Now that we have completed the organization section, we will move on to the usability section.
Your task is to find the user: “rile”’s post on their favorite classical composer. Now that you have completed this task, please answer the following questions.

<br>-Was there anything difficult or confusing about the search process?

<br>-How was your experience with navigating the results you received?

<br>-Feel free to leave any additional criticism of the community page’s usability that was not prompted by the questions above.</p>

<p>Now that you have completed all of the tasks, I ask you to give the website a rating from 1-4 (1 = Unacceptable; 2 = Needs Improvement; 3 = Satisfactory; 4 = No Changes Should Be Made) for each of the broader task categories including Visual Appeal, Organization, and Usability. Please briefly explain your rationale for each choice as well.

<br>Thank you for your input and take care!"</p>
