					<p class="indent">It was about 2 a.m when a sound woke me up. It was the sound of hands clapping as deafening as the roar of a jet engine. Although the sound came from an adjoining room, it stabbed my ears as if it were right next to me. I sprung up from the bed with the urgency of a mousetrap and sat with my upper half perpendicular to the sunken mattress below. By the time I identified the sound as clapping, it ceased.</p>
					<p class="indent">As I scanned my surroundings, each object in my room remained fearfully still as if held at gunpoint. I swung my legs to the left and gripped them against the rigid angle of the bedside as I lowered my feet to the carpet below. At this point I stood up, advancing my weary gaze beyond the doorway when its initial blackness made a camera lens transition to an opaque white. Despite the abrupt change, my eyes didn’t need to adapt to the color shift. As I stepped through the door, all the angles that gave the space its shape erased themselves until nothing except me was discernible.</p>
					<p class="indent">Then multi-toned teapot screams shot at me from all directions as the white began to redden with boiling wrath. At this point,  my vision buzzed around the scene as purple, blue and green circled around me at wash cycle speed. Despite my primal forward sprints, I was being pulled back in swift, trace-like motions. When I looked up, I was in my living room and it was day.</p>
					<p class="indent">There was no one around but I heard a crowd. Each time I turned to locate the sound it jumped behind me until I found it behind the tall wooden door. As I paced forward, the voices got higher, chanted louder, laughed faster, and then I pulled the doorknob. Outside, all was bright in pastel shades. Familiar cars sat comfortably on their asphalt driveways and the corresponding houses fit snugly into their plots. No sounds beyond my shortened breath occupied the landscape. What was once the sound of chattering crowds morphed into thousands of invisible eyes focused on a single point.</p>
					<p class="indent">Before I made any further movement, all became black. I couldn’t see my hands or any part of my body and I was enmeshed in the nothing that consumed me. That’s when I saw my head spinning in front of me in aimless jolts until it stopped and faced me directly. I could feel the bending fabric under me as a single strand of moonlight tapped at my right eye. I let my head fall on its left side to look at the time. It was midnight.</p>
