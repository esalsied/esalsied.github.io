					<p class="indent">Although Buddhism has been referenced in contexts historical contexts in the past, it often suffers from the same issue that other ancient schools of thought suffer from as a result of their age which is the utilization of their core concepts for practical use. Practicality does not fit with many ancient ideas because they have either lost relevance or only apply to certain groups of people. Fortunately, the teachings of Buddhism do not fall into that category. Over the course of this paper, I would like to give a summary of an excerpt from Mark Sidertis’s <i>Buddhism As Philosophy</i>. I shall then provide a description of what exactly the teachings of Buddhism, specifically the five skandhas, are actually stating. Then I will make a case for this argument, a case against it, and will then respond to the case against it.</p>
					<p class="indent">The paper begins with the clarification that Buddha’s definition of the word ‘self’ is: something that must always be present in an individual in order for said individual to exist. They then establish that the self we are referring to is the thing we call ‘I’. At this point, the author outlines what are known as the five skandhas, a bundle of constituent parts which include: the Rupa/form which is anything we are physically composed of, feelings, specifically pain, pleasure, and indifference, perception, or the acknowledgment of something’s characteristics via the five senses, volition or the mental workings that prompt certain physical actions or emotions, and consciousness or the awareness of one’s own mental and physical states. The author then states that Buddha’s reason for creating the five skandhas was to determine whether there is any aspect of the ‘self’ that cannot be classified within these five components. After this, the author describes Buddha’s thought process behind there being no self which is based upon the idea that the self would have to be something that is permanent meaning that it is eternal, constantly existing, and never ceasing to exist. From here, Buddha notes that none of the five skandhas are impermanent and that the self does not in fact exist. Another component of the five skandha assertion rests upon the idea of anti-reflexivity meaning that nothing has the ability to act upon itself. Using this, Buddha’s argument states that one can seek to change their Rupa, feelings, perception, volition, and consciousness but none perform the executive action of creating change. Buddha then states that if the self were to exist, it would have to be this executive entity but that, since it does not fit within the confines of the five skandhas, the self still does not exist.</p>
					<p class="indent">Given the central concept in Buddha's argument, we, as individual human beings, will likely feel a greater sense of appreciation of the world around us as well as a humbleness regarding our place in it. This reaction stems from the implications that come along with Buddha's argument. If we accept the idea that we are merely a combination of forms, feelings, perceptions, volitions, and a conscience with no self attached, it follows we can categorize other sentient organisms within the same parameters. From this conclusion comes the idea that any concept we may have had of superiority over other organisms is an illusion brought on by the emotions we project onto the differences we perceive between us and said organism. Once one is able to convince themselves that differences are of little importance, they can begin to learn to have a certain respect for all of the organisms that surround them all the while realizing that they are merely a component of their environment rather than some kind of superior observer of said environment. Buddha's argument can also lead us to be less affected by the harmful remarks that others direct towards us. Buddha's argument states that anything that we perceive as being our 'self' is merely a combination of particular facets of the five skandhas and is, therefore, an illusion of self. The aspect of the harmful remarks others make that 'hurts' is the aspect of the remark which attacks what we perceive to be our own self. Therefore, embracing the idea that what these individuals attack is, within itself, an illusion reveals that they are stuck in their own misguided train of thought which then shows that, much like you, they are stuck in an illusory state and thus have no true power over you by way of their words. The emotion that follows from this realization of another's illusion should not be a mockery of their misunderstanding but rather an appreciation that someone else associates identity with illusion and that you are not alone in your own misguided illusory sense of self. When these realizations are brought together into a single individual the result is one who is fascinated that the constituent parts of the world whether it’s an individual, an ecosystem, etc. can culminate into a thing that is beyond one's beliefs or convictions; a single presence.</p>
					<p class="indent">The argument given previously states that, through the five skandhas argument central to Buddhism, humans will develop a sense of unity with their environment leading to an appreciation for the place that everything else in the surrounding environment has, then stating that this appreciation then develops into humbleness which ultimately creates an 'individual' who is fascinated with the world and who rarely get offended by the hurtful comments of others. What I believe this argument does not consider is the possibility that one can reach the emotional states described by other means as well as the negative aspects of one believing that there is no self. The traits of humbleness and curiosity, which this argument puts a great deal of emphasis on, are very universal traits that are more a result of personality and character rather than ideology. This is why these characteristics can be seen in those who do not follow the teachings of Buddhism or hold no concept of it in their minds; this does not mean that these traits are inherent in their respective inhabitants but rather that there are a wide variety of external influences that result in said individual's characteristics. This argument also has a tendency to romanticize the reaction that most people will have to believing in the implications of the five skandhas, stating that the individual will feel connected to the world around them as they realize that their place in it is much smaller than they likely thought before. While this is a plausible outcome of believing Buddha's argument it is also equally plausible that one will have a much more negative reaction to said realization. The central idea around the five skandhas is that there is no self and that anything we perceive as being 'ourselves' is an illusion brought on by a combination of several of the skandhas working together. For some, this could initiate an existential crisis or depressive state, interpreting this argument as evidence that they have no value and that their presence or absence means little to nothing to the world around them. The self, illusion or not, is what most individuals use as a filter to construct a world that possesses subjective meaning that they can 'make sense of.' So when this concept is taken away it may feel as if there is very little for one to latch onto, that there are very few if any things to work towards. While the five skandhas may instill curiosity and humbleness in some, it is equally likely that one can learn the same values from a number of other sources and that this mindset can damage the positive effects of the concept which so many hold dear.</p>
					<p class="indent">The previous paragraph presents the argument that the teachings of the five skandhas are not necessary for one to achieve the supposed benefits such as empathy and harmony with the surrounding world and goes on to say that concepts such as the ‘lack of self’ can actually have the opposite effect on those who interpret the concept as saying that one’s reality is an illusion that is not worth the effort to keep existing in. The premise of this argument is sound and is a valid response to the argument previously mentioned but it also seems to suffer from interpreting the word choice of said argument as having spoken in absolutes. It is important to understand that the defense of the use of the five skandhas for practical use is not arguing that the individual must follow the five skandhas or they will not achieve the mentioned states of mind but rather a suggestion that this concept may be helpful for anyone wishing to incorporate these tendencies into their life. The argument against the practical use of the five skandhas in fact further supports the intent of the initial argument. The argument against the practical use of the five skandhas shows that there are many ways one can achieve the mentioned states of mind showing that the act of opening one’s mind to the facets of the surrounding world is not a black or white process. The goal of this paper is not solely to suggest that the five skandhas are a possible way for one to become more mindful and less judgemental but is also encouraging the reader to choose a path that best suits them rather than a path that is best for every individual. In this sense, these arguments pair together well and provide the reader with a choice which is perhaps the best one can offer another when they want the other to make their own decisions.</p>
