			<h1>A Panel Discussion of the Final Scene from Chapter 22 of <i>Blood Meridian</i></h1>

<p>Moderator: ‘This discussion will be focused specifically on the following passage from Cormac McCarthy’s novel Blood Meridian, which all panel members have already read in full.’</p>
	“He made his way among the corpses and stood before her. She was very old and her face was gray and leathery and sand had collected in the folds of her clothing. She did not look up. The shawl that covered her head was much faded of its color yet it bore like a patent woven into the fabric the figures of stars and quartermoons and other insignia of a providence unknown to him. He spoke to her in a low voice. He told her that he would convey her to a safe place, some party of her countrypeople who would welcome her and that she should join them for he could not leave her in this place or she would surely die.
	He knelt on one knee, resting the rifle before him like a staff. Abuelita, he said. No puedes escúchame? (Translation: Can’t you hear me?)
	He reached into the little cove and touched her arm. She moved slightly, her whole body, light and rigid. She weighed nothing. She was just a dried shell and she had been dead in that place for years.” (Pgs. 327-28)

<p>Moderator: ‘The first portion of our panel discussion will discuss the following question: Is the woman human in the Kid’s eyes? Each panel member will state their case and then the floor will be open for free discussion. We will start with Dr. Johnson.’</p>
<p>Johnson: ‘In this passage, the Kid believes he is speaking to this woman as a genuinely concerned human being. However, I argue that he is simply projecting his idea of what he thinks the woman may be as a means of confronting his fears about his own reality rather than being legitimately concerned about that which the woman faces. By convincing himself that what he sees before him is a human, the Kid has constructed an object, an empty vessel, absent of life so that he can fill it with his own self-centered concerns. This is where the concept of apostrophe, or the addressing of a nonhuman object or absent individual and ascribing human qualities to it or them as a result. It is only when he is given physical proof of the literal hollowness of the woman that he finally realizes that she is not something he can apostrophize as she never possessed a human form he could take advantage of when he encountered her body. In this sense, reality forces the Kid to abandon his own exploitative understanding of what the woman can be.’</p> 
<p>Moderator: ‘Dr. Singh?’</p>
<p>Singh: ‘In this passage, the Kid conceives of the woman as something he can achieve mastery over, which functions as his way of believing she is human. We can initially see this when the Kid tells the woman that he can take her to a safe place. Although this gesture may first come across as concerned and caring and may actually be, he is still assuming a certain authority over the woman as if he is the harbinger of safety even though he is under the constant threat of violence both before and after this scene. Because mastery requires the recognition of another party to truly validate the mastering individual’s perception of themselves as a master, the Kid cannot truly attain this state in the woman’s presence. For this reason, he cannot conceive of her as fully human even when he still believes she is alive and able to acknowledge him the way a human would.’</p> 
<p>Moderator: ‘Dr. Weheliye?’</p>

<p>Weheliye: ‘When the Kid first comes across the woman, he recognizes her as what I will term not-quite-human. By fitting her into this category, he can ascribe characteristics to her that he deems most convenient while ignoring human characteristics she would possess if she were deemed fully human. The Kid only recognizes the woman as human insofar as she can hear what he has to say and fulfill a role as an individual submissive to the will he asserts in being a liberal humanist subject. Although the woman’s status as a human is waning in the Kid’s eyes the more he attempts to interact with her, she only completely becomes non-human to him when he realizes that she no longer possesses life in any capacity. Even before he gets to this point though, The Kid has taken the opportunity to fit the woman into a racial category primarily by distinguishing between his people and her people, as if the racial division between them is the defining characteristic that separates them.’
<p>Moderator: ‘Dr. Alaimo?’</p>

<p>Alaimo: ‘The Kid’s perception of the woman as human remains constant throughout his interaction with her. However, what changes is that he goes from recognizing her through the lens of a corporeal human being with full agency and control to realizing that she is now transcorporeal and cannot be separated from her surrounding environment. Although the woman can no longer fulfill the functions of a corporeal being, the state the Kid comes to realize she is in leads him to a more accurate understanding of the relatively minor role humans play in the grand scheme of the world. Before he realizes she is deceased, the Kid can single the woman out from her surrounding environment and conceive of her as somehow separate from its influences. Although this concept of the human overestimates the centrality of humans in the surrounding world, it is ultimately what allows him to identify her as human.’</p>
<p>Moderator: ‘Dr. Taylor?’</p>

<p>Taylor: ‘Since the Kid finds the woman within a larger group of people who have been slaughtered, he has reason to believe that she is injured in some capacity when he encounters her. This combined with the fact that he recognizes her as an old woman makes it likely that he views her as a disabled individual and is inherently dependent on him. The concern he shows for her wellbeing indicates he recognizes her as human at a basic moral level, but it is not long before he concludes that she cannot speak for herself. This is implicit in his question to her before he discovers that she is deceased. It is notable that, in asking whether the woman can hear, that the Kid puts the focus back on himself as if his own independence is being put into question. In this sense, the Kid perhaps feels forced into the role of a dependent through his reliance on the woman’s response and is frustrated because he views himself as her independent superior.’</p> 

<p>Moderator: ‘Now we will move on to an open discussion of whether or not the Kid sees the woman as human in this scene.’</p>

<p>Alaimo: ‘I would like to start the discussion by addressing Dr. Weheliye’s argument. While I agree with the observation that the Kid’s perception changes when he realizes that the woman is deceased, I do not think this changes the degree to which he views her as human. If the Kid did not view the woman as fully human, he would not interact with her the way he does. We see this initially in this passage in the first sentence when the woman is singled out from all that surrounds her in the environment. Even though the Kid is mistaken in thinking the woman can be independent of her surroundings, this action falls within the dominant line of thinking wherein humans view other humans as corporeal rather than transcorporeal beings. Ultimately, the change in the Kid’s perception of the woman is a result of him realizing that she is just as much a part of her surrounding environment as everything else rather than that she has somehow become less human in his eyes because she is deceased.’</p> 

<p>Johnson: ‘I agree with Dr. Alaimo’s assertion that the Kid’s perception of the woman as a human does not change throughout his interaction with her. However, this is not to make the Kid out to be some sort of humanitarian figure. Rather, it is because he views her as a human that he can project his own worries onto her. If the Kid’s concept of the woman as being human was constantly changing, he would have little reason to apostrophize her because he would not be giving her the consistent recognition that he does in this passage. The recognition of the woman as a human is the preconceived notion that the Kid’s apostrophization of her relies on.’</p>  

<p>Singh: ‘I side with both Dr. Alaimo and Dr. Johnson in the assertion that the Kid consistently views the woman as human during his entire interaction with her. I would add that the way the Kid tries to establish authority over the woman is also an indication of his recognizing her as human. We see this in the passage where there is mention of the Kid lowering his voice to speak to the woman. This act of lowering one’s voice is an attempt at being perceived as authoritative which brings him closer to a state of mastery over her. However, there would be no reason for the Kid to make this adjustment if he did not believe that the woman was capable of becoming the subject of his mastery. If the Kid does not see the woman as human, there is very little motivating him to attempt to achieve mastery over her the way he does in this passage.’

<p>Weheliye: ‘Dr. Alaimo, Johnson, and Singh all bring up compelling arguments for why the Kid’s perception of the woman as a human is unwavering throughout his interaction with her. However, I still stand by my original argument that his initial view of her as not-quite-human and then later as nonhuman is what changes throughout his interaction. It is important to note that the not-quite-human can still be given some human characteristics. However, the defining feature of the not-quite-human is that human characteristics can be revoked just as easily as they are given. When a person is initially seen as human, the human characteristics one attributes to them cannot be easily revoked, instead requiring a more sustained form of dehumanization. Due to each category’s defining features, it is easier for the not-quite-human to become nonhuman than it is for the human to do the same. In this passage, we see that the Kid’s interaction with the woman ends as soon as he realizes she is deceased. If the Kid had seen the woman as human the entire time, his actions would have displayed more resistance Instead, the passage and chapter end because he believes that something nonhuman no longer deserves his attention in any respect.’</p> 

<p>Taylor: ‘While I agree with Dr. Alaimo, Johnson, and Singh insofar as the Kid needs to view the woman as human to project further constructs onto her, I also side with Dr. Weheliye’s assertion that the woman’s status as human changes throughout the Kid’s interaction with her. Those who are labeled as disabled and dependent occupy a role similar to that of the not-quite-human. On the surface, the disabled person is seemingly given human qualities by others. This changes, however, when the behavior of a disabled person diverges from what is expected of them. At this point, the independent party feels justified in putting down the disabled person because they are disobeying their role as independent and thus deserve to be dehumanized as a result. In the passage, the Kid treats the woman as dependent until he realizes that, in being deceased, she is independent of anything he is trying to project onto her. Once the Kid realizes this, he feels justified in stripping away the few human characteristics he was giving her, leaving her as a worthless nonhuman object.’</p> 

<p>Moderator: ‘Now we will move on to our second question: Is the woman human in the eyes of McCarthy’s narrator? We will start again with Dr. Johnson going in the same order we did for the previous question.’</p> 

<p>Johnson: ‘I do not think that McCarthy’s narrator sees the woman as human but rather plays along with the Kid to capture his desperation in the situation. In a certain sense, the narrator is apostrophizing the Kid as he makes the character’s mistaken identification of the woman as living into an avenue for his own broader concerns about the state of empty hopefulness the Kid’s environment and circumstances have forced him into. This is by no means a criticism of McCarthy but rather a recognition that a large part of the narrator’s role in putting the characters through certain situations is as a means of apostrophizing their own wider concerns about the world. So while the narrator’s omniscience indicates their conception of the woman as no longer human, they hope that she may be apostrophized through the Kid who gets to experience this harsh reality firsthand.’</p> 

<p>Moderator: ‘Dr. Singh?’</p>

<p>Singh: ‘Throughout this novel, McCarthy’s narrator maintains a characteristically objective narrative voice that indicates the omniscience Dr. Johnson just described. Because they possess this omniscience, the narrator’s mastery over this world cannot be put into question by its characters even if they fail to recognize it. For this reason, the narrator not only does not view the woman as a human but likely does not even view this question as a legitimate area of inquiry. Although the narrator’s mastery is implicit in their narration style it is not independent of the systems of mastery that exist in the real world. When one realizes this, it becomes apparent that McCarthy’s narrative voice is not truly an exhaustive indication of who or what is ultimately considered human. Because of this, it is legitimate to call into question the authority of the narrator’s seemingly objective view of this situation and the portrayal of the woman as a lifeless, nonhuman husk.’</p>

<p>Moderator: ‘Dr. Weheliye?’</p>

<p>Weheliye: ‘As others have mentioned, McCarthy’s consistently omniscient narrative tone is the key to understanding whether they view the woman as human or not. While the Kid seems to be capable of shifting his categorization of the woman between not-quite-human and nonhuman, McCarthy’s narrator appears to treat all that they encounter as nonhuman by default. In this sense, the narrator does not see the woman as human and simply just sees her without any designation of implicit identity. The same can be said for the narrator’s view of the Kid and any other character in the novel. Ultimately, the concept of a human is not something the narrator is concerned with as their goal is to report on the events of the novel rather than further project human constructs onto the narrative. By being so far removed from the concept of the human, the narrator becomes a more effective arbiter of the grim truth of the novel’s reality, which itself makes no distinction between humans and nonhumans.’</p> 

<p>Moderator: ‘Dr. Alaimo?’</p>

<p>Alaimo: ‘McCarthy’s narrator seems to have thrown out the idea of the human altogether and instead favors a more transcorporeal view of the world. Throughout the novel more generally as well as in this specific section, the narrator pays equal attention to humans and the natural world that surrounds them. Although this view of the world likely comes across as cold and detached to the reader, the narrator is depicting a more accurate view of reality that humans are not capable of portraying. Despite humanity being portrayed as less human through the narrator’s eyes, the narrator still recognizes beings as human and does not completely disregard this category but rather puts it in a more accurate context within the larger world, which goes far beyond the limits of the human experience and understanding of the world.’</p> 

<p>Moderator: ‘Dr. Taylor?’</p>

<p>Taylor: ‘Since McCarthy’s narrator seems to represent a largely zoomed-out perspective of humanity and its function, humans seem to all be viewed on an equal plane. In this sense, there is no distinction between a disabled and able-bodied human as, in the eyes of this narrator, they both possess a common dependence on the world. So it seems that by being able to disregard the idea of the human, the narrator can present a more equal view of humanity and its collective struggle than a human perspective would with its focus on individual struggle and differences that make some independent and others dependent.’</p>

<p>Moderator: ‘Now we will move on to our final open discussion centered around the question of whether or not McCarthy’s narrator views the woman as human in this scene.’</p>

<p>Taylor: ‘I would like to start the discussion by expressing my disagreement with Dr. Johnson’s argument that the narrator reveals their attitude about the world of the novel as a result of apostrophizing the Kid in this scene. It seems to me that, in this scene, the narrator avoids personalizing their narration as much as possible. Each sentence of the paragraph is declarative and states what is happening rather than what the Kid is feeling. When we view the narrator this way, only characters within the novel such as the Kid are capable of utilizing projective concepts like apostrophization among the others we discussed in response to the previous question. This includes my concept of the disabled and dependent individual who is no different from anything else within this novel’s world in the narrator’s eyes.’</p>  

<p>Alaimo: ‘I agree with Dr. Taylor’s argument that the narration is more of an account of what is happening in the novel’s world than a projection of the narrator’s own beliefs about that world. I would like to add that the narration of this passage only briefly focuses on the human qualities of the woman. The remainder of the passage describes her clothing, the Kid’s attempts at communication, and the surroundings of the scene. In this sense, the narrator’s view of the novel’s world transcorporeally shifts from thing to thing, always favoring that which draws the most attention in the scene regardless of whether it is human or not. Ultimately, the narrator lets the collective environment progress the scene naturally rather than shifting it with their own intentions.’</p>

<p>Singh: ‘I agree with Dr. Taylor and Dr. Alaimo insofar as the narrator is not directly projecting their beliefs about the novel's world into their narration and instead favors a seemingly more objective telling of the story. However, we must take into account that the narrator’s mastery over this world is inherent as they lie beyond all the violence and suffering that occurs within it. In this sense, the narrator is fundamentally above everything in the novel, human or otherwise. While this initially seems to provide a more objective narration, the narrator still possesses the bias of including certain details over others. The narrator easily could have focused on different details to relay the events of this scene that would have changed the way the reader interpreted it. So I think it is important that we account for the bias present as a result of the narrator’s mastery and use its existence as a means of questioning the narrator’s perspective.’</p>  

<p>Johnson: ‘I think that all of my fellow theorists have made some great points so far in this discussion. I still stand by my belief that the narrator is intentionally revealing the empty hopelessness of the Kid to make a broader point about his emotional state. Dr. Alaimo’s observation that the narrator’s perspective is inherently limited just like any other potential perspective strengthens this assertion because the reality of any form of narration is that the narrator must choose specific details over others and must be biased to a certain degree as a result. On the other hand, Dr. Taylor and Dr. Singh’s points have convinced me that the narrator is not directly apostrophizing their worldview onto the Kid in this case. Instead, I argue that the narration functions as a tool that allows the reader to apostrophize their own beliefs and convictions onto the events and characters of the novel.’</p>

<p>Weheliye: ‘Like Dr. Johnson, my thinking about this question has changed as a result of our discussion. Initially, I believed that the narrator viewed the novel’s world as inherently nonhuman given the disregard for human moral characteristics there appears to be in the narration of this scene. However, Dr. Taylor and Dr. Johnson’s argument that the category of the human is of little to no concern to the narrator has led me to believe that the narrator does not know or, more likely, does not care about the categories human, not-quite-human, and nonhuman simply because they are categories that the narrator is already inherently above. Instead, the narrator sees a world where that which exhibits the greatest strength prevails, be it the natural world or those who know how to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>Moderator: ‘That concludes our discussion. Thank you all for a fruitful conversation! Take care.’</p>
